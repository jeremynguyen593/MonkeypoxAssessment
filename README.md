## Monkeypox Assessment

Welcome to the Monkeypox Assessment! This is my first project ever and I created it after hearing the (terrifying) news of Monkeypox cases surging in America.

## Project Description

The project uses Java and its libraries to make this project come to life. Using the Swing library for front-end, this assessment uses basic GUIs to guide you through the assessment. After answering the questions in the assessment, you will be prompted a page where ur risk factor will show with a color coded banner to indicate how "at risk" you are of having the virus. You will then have the option to see ur results in full detail or just simply exit out of the program.
